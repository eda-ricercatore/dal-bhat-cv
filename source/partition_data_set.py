	This Python script is written by Zhiyang Ong to partition
		a data set into the following ratios for the following
		purposes.
	# 2:1:1 (50%, 25%, 25%) for training, validation, and testing
		in machine learning.
	# 2:1 (67%, 33%) for training and cross validation.



	#### IMPORTANT NOTES:
	[Insert references for why the aforementioned ratios were
		chosen for YOLO, one-shot detection, and similar
		machine learning techniques]


	References:
	Citations/References that use the LaTeX/BibTeX notation are taken
		from my BibTeX database (set of BibTeX entries).
