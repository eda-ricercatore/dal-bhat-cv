#	To-Do List



Assumed knowledge and skills that are prerequisites for embedded machine/deep learning - good to know, but not necessarily required.
+ [numerical linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_linear_algebra)
	- [matrix decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition)
		* singular-value decomposition (SVD)
		* LU decomposition
		* QR decomposition (or QR factorization)
	- [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)
		* Gaussâ€“Jordan elimination
+ [Vector calculus, or vector analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus)
+ [Ordinary differential equations, ODEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)
+ [partial differential equation, PDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)
+ [multi-objective optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization)
+ [design space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_space_exploration)



To-do list:
+ learn how to implement a graph data structure using the adjacency map graph representation \cite[\S14.2, pp. 627; \S14.2.3, pp. 632]{Goodrich2013}.
	- Do so using object-oriented analysis and design (or object-oriented programming) in [*Python*](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/notes/python.md)
+ Learn the basics of [object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection)
	- Know the difference between [training and inference](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/08/22/difference-deep-learning-training-inference-ai/)
	- For object detection solutions based on neural networks, including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning algorithms, we should have a neural network for training, and an approximate version of the training neural network for inference.
	- That is, the inference neural network is an approximate model of the training neural network.
	- Partition the data set given to us into a internal training data set (2/3 of the given data set), and an internal test data set (1/3 of the given data set for inference).
+ Find a data set for an [object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection) problem in [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)
	- Implement an [end-to-end solution](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/19057/end-to-end-solution-e2es), or complete solution, for that object detection problem (e.g., detecting a cat, flower, or drone).
		* Create a [SQL database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) to store records of image/video and its corresponding label.
			+ Each record in the database is a [2-tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple).
			+ [A database is a set of records.](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/gulyas-scripts/blob/master/notes/databases_and_information_systems.md)
		* Read in each image/video from the data set as an input
		* Detect if the specific object (e.g., a cat, flower, or drone) is detected in the image/video
			+ Use TensorFlow and Keras to implement our convolutional/recurrent neural networks (CNN/RNN) for deep learning.
		* If specific object **is in** the image/video, return detected.
			+ Associate that particular image/video with the label "detected".
		* If specific object **is not in** the image/video, return "not detected".
			+ Associate that particular image/video with the label "not detected".
	- Important Note: You can probably find an implementation (or complete solution) for a number of object detection problems online.
	- This step helps you become familiar with the object detection problem.
+ Customize the end-to-end solution, or our object detection "flow," for drone detection.
	- This step helps you become familiar with the specific drone detection problem.
+ Approximate the training neural network to produce the inference neural network.
	- Use the [SqueezeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SqueezeNet) framework to sparsify the CNN/RNN (i.e., make the graph representation of the CNN/RNN more sparse), so that we can optimize for performance and get the CNN/RNN to fit into our chosen CUDA-based GPU platform.
+ Implement the inference neural network using C++17 and CUDA on the target GPU platform.
+ Iterate this process for different CNN/RNN architectures to perform multi-objective design space exploration of various choices/parameters, so that we can pick a suitable Pareto-optimal CNN/RNN architecture.
